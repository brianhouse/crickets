have a master list of cricket names, and then have the manager functions look for them util they are all uploaded

## Questions

- dynamics of the PIR
    -> seems a bit twitchy — try the version with controls
    https://www.adafruit.com/product/5578    


- large network dynamics
    -> try asymmetrical peering with 3 crickets
    -> check what other peer management functions there are with ESP-now
    (right now I'm just clearing individually — can I clear as a group?)


- lighting
    -> two internal LEDs?

- OTA programming
    -> set the params in a config that survives reboot? show that it's spread?

- housing
    -> ziji


## Design

- turn on the red light when burrring

- a period after motion where it doesn't care about motion (that's a way of making it less sensitive)

- do people carry a battery-powered one in? is that an alternative to the PIR?
  but what triggers them to look around? can that work in the code via timers w/o 
  losing the place in the cycle?
