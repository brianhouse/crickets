I need to know all their connection lists

what if I have a single point controller, attached to the computer, and then they all report to it?

so they all report to the controller, and then they form X number of other bonds

ok, wait. if I'm trying to connect remotely and load stuff, maybe I can do that from Kere.

so with UDP, you connect to the AP, and then you can open a socket and send and receive. but is that redundant with ESP-NOW?

I'd need to run a webserver also so that I can "pull". tcp/ip.

so, model 1, I can also query the crickets and get their peer lists from a mac.

I could also potentially reprogram them that way. I like that it's separate.
